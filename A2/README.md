# 🌐 Interactive Portfolio Website – Assignment 2

## 🧠 Description
This project is a modern and fully rebuilt version of my previous personal portfolio website, created using React and Vite.
I decided to rebuild it from scratch to apply cleaner code practices, improved structure, and more advanced React features.

The website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and services as a full-stack developer, featuring smooth transitions, subtle animations, and a fully responsive layout.

This updated version introduces interactive components, a validated contact form, and AI-assisted enhancements that helped improve code organization, performance, and maintainability.

## ✨ Features
- **Modern UI:** Glassmorphism theme with smooth animations.
-  **Responsive Design:** Works on all screen sizes.
-  **Services Carousel:** Swipe or click to explore service cards.
-  **Projects Grid:** Interactive cards with hover overlays.
-  **Contact Form:** Input validation for Full Name, Email, and Message.
-  **Error Handling:** Inline validation messages.
-  **AI-Enhanced Development:** Used AI to debug, clean, and restructure components.
